                        <p>Australia’s most popular coffee drink is always served in a glass and prepared with espresso, mostly steamed milk and a small dollop of froth on top.</p>

                        <p>While some argue that this is exactly the same as a latte, others will distinguish that flat whites are made with a shot of espresso and steamed milk that is an equal blend of liquid milk and micro-froth.</p>

                        <p>This Italian classic is made with one shot of espresso and steamed milk that has a much thicker layer of froth. Oftentimes, it is served in a cup and sprinkled with chocolate dust.</p>

                        <p>Traditionally, a macchiato is just a single shot of espresso with a dollop of steamed milk served in a small glass; however, a “long mac” includes two shots of espresso instead.</p>

                        <p>Similar to an “Americano” this Australian classic is made with a double shot of espresso that is topped up with hot water.</p>

                        <h4>Ristretto</h4>
                        <p>Often mistaken as simply one half of an espresso, a ristretto is actually a short shot of espresso made with the same amount of ground coffee but half the amount of water.</p>

                    Australia is the sixth largest country in the world. 
                    Its ocean territory is the world's third largest, 
                    spanning three oceans and covering around 12 million square kilometres.

                    Nearly seven million square kilometres, 
                    or 91 per cent of Australia, is covered by native vegetation. 
                    Although this figure may seem high,
                     many of Australia's desert landscapes are covered by native plants such as saltbush, 
                     albeit sparsely.

                    For tens of thousands of years, 
                    the lives and sense of cultural identity of Indigenous Australians were inextricably linked to the land, its forms, 
                    flora and fauna. Today, the identity of all Australians is shaped by a relationship with the natural environment.

                    Australia is one of the most urbanised and coast-dwelling populations in the world. 
                    More than 80 per cent of Australians live within 100 kilometres of the coast.
